# Learning Platform Insights

An education analytics project focused on understanding user engagement, category performance, and device-based usage patterns using platform interaction data.

---

## Objective  
The goal of this project is to extract actionable insights from e-learning platform data to help stakeholders enhance user experience, optimize content delivery, and identify key behavioral trends.

---

## Dataset Overview  
The dataset contains learning behavior data segmented by course categories and user device types.

**Key Fields Included:**
- Course Category  
- Device Type (Mobile/Desktop)  
- User Count  
- Completion Percentage  
- Average Time Spent  
- Average Quiz Score  

---

## Tools Used  
- Tableau Public  
- Google Sheets  
- SQL (for querying and structuring data)  
- VS Code (for documentation & version control)  

---

## Analysis Performed

1. **User Count by Device Type and Category**  
   Identified how many users accessed each course category using mobile or desktop devices.

2. **Completion Percentage by Category**  
   Compared average course completion percentages across all categories to determine engagement levels.

3. **Average Time Spent per Category**  
   Tracked how much time learners spend in different course categories to assess depth of engagement.

4. **Average Quiz Score and User Count**  
   Evaluated performance by combining quiz score averages with user counts to identify effective categories.

5. **Health Category User Distribution by Device**  
   Focused analysis on the Health category to reveal device preferences among users.

---

## Key Insights

- **Mobile is Dominant**: Most users accessed healthcare content via mobile devices.  
- **Higher Engagement in Health Category**: Health showed the highest user count and above-average completion rates.  
- **Average Time vs. Completion Trade-Off**: Some categories with higher average time spent had lower completion rates, indicating possible friction or difficulty.  
- **Quiz Score Consistency**: Scores remained fairly consistent across device types, suggesting usability was maintained regardless of platform.

---

## Outcome  
This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand which course categories perform best, which devices learners prefer, and where optimization can improve learning outcomes. It reflects the ability to:

- Build and publish dynamic dashboards  
- Interpret engagement data in context  
- Segment by category and device for deeper insights  
- Create business-ready visualizations for strategic decision-making
