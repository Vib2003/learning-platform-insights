#  SQL + Tableau Dashboard Project: Online Course Engagement Analysis

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data using SQL for analysis and Tableau for visual storytelling. The dataset revolves around user engagement in various online course categories, analyzed across different device types and learning outcomes.

---

##  Objective

The goal of this project was to:
- Extract meaningful insights from raw course data using SQL
- Visualize engagement trends through a well-structured Tableau dashboard
- Highlight behavioral patterns in user learning across devices and course types

---

##  What the Dashboard Shows

The dashboard offers a multi-faceted view of online course engagement. Key insights include:

-  **Average Course Completion Percentage**  
  An overall gauge of how committed users are to completing their chosen courses.

-  **Completion Rate by Category**  
  Visual comparison of how different course topics perform in terms of completion.

-  **User Count by Device & Category**  
  A breakdown showing which device types (mobile/desktop) dominate usage across various course categories.

-  **Average Time Spent per Category**  
  Which topics hold users' attention the longest.

-  **Average Quiz Score by Category**  
  Measures how well users are retaining what they’ve learned.

-  **Health Category Focus**  
  A deep dive into how users engage with Health-related content by device type.
